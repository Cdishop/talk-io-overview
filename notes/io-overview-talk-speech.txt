Thank you for the introduction, that was great. I'm excited to talk to you all today. I really enjoyed my time at USD, and I was happy when Nadav reached out and asked me to speak. As was just stated, I'm an organizational psychologist. I study behavior in the workplace. I study psychological functioning in the workplace. I'm going to start with an image, with a plot, a visualization. In 2014, there was a group of researchers who assessed the amount of time Americans spent on various activities across their day. How much time do you spend sleeping? How much time do you spend at work? How much time do you spend pursuing leisure activities? Here were there results.

On the right is a map of each activity, and on the left is a time stamp that will continue across the entire day. The results are not surprising. Most people go to work around 8 or 9am, and they stay there until about 5pm. Afterwards, they spend some time on leisure and then go to bed around 10 or 11pm. I show you this simply to say that you are going to spend a lot of your life at work. Even if you don't go into my field, you will definitely have a job, and so it is usefull to know a little bit about some of the relevant variables, some of the relevant process that go on in this space.

Todays talk is sort of 2 things. It's a general overview of my field. Organizational psychology, industrial organizational psychology. But that overview is going to be slanted toward the research that I focus on. I don't have time to cover every topic that people examine in this field, so I'm going to present a few topics that I find interesting. It's a biased overview that is biased in the direction of topics that I care about. What I'm going to do is broach a number of topics, and for each one I'll talk about what we know and don't know in that given domain. What are some of the predictors, correlates, and things to think about. 

This talk won't take the full 45 minutes; I'll only talk for about 35 minutes. So at the end there will be plently of time if you want to ask questions about Michigan State or graduate school life or academic stuff beyond undergrad. I'm also happy to talk offline or to schedule a zoom chat at another date so feel free to contact me. 

I'm going to offer a caveat at both the beginning and end of this talk. First, I just wanted to say that a lot of research in my field is observational. So although I'll use phrases like "we know this and we know that," keep in mind that it's from observational research. Here's the typical study in my field. I go to Coca-cola, get 600 employees, and give each of them a survey. That survey measures stress and the extnet to which they perceive that their work environment is fair. Low and behold, I find that the employees who think their work environment is not fair are also the employees who are stressed. That kind of study is the prototype in my field. Yes we measured actual employees, which is good, but we didn't have any experimental control, we didn't manipulate, and we certainly didn't have random assignment. So, in a "general overview" talk I have to be a little bit abstract and make it sound like we have absolute evidence of some of these things, but please keep in mind that there are limitations and some of those limitations are fairly severe. 

# Meaningfulness and satisfaction

So here we go, the fist topic is meaningfulness at work. What do we know about being satisfied at your job. Being engaged at work. Holding positive evalations toward your work sitaution. Often people will approach this domain from what's known as the job characteristics perspective. This area has been the subject of many reviews and it's been around for quite some time. It points to a set of features that are relevant to consider. Autonomy means that you have some ability to make decisions in how tasks are completed. It does not mean that you are never told what to do. It simply means that, after being told what to do, you then have some leeway to decide how the work to be done gets carried out. Task idendity refers to whether or not you see the project from start to finish. Are you involved from when the artifact is first developed as an idea to when it is finished completely? Think about writing a paper. I come up with the idea. I write the outlet. I write the paper. I get feedback, make some edits, perhaps present the paper at a conference. I saw the artifact and worked with the artifact from start to finish, so the task has more identity and is typically more satisfying than something where I only complete a minute aspect of a project. Significance means that I interact with or bear witness to the people who realize benefits from my work. Think about those in the medical field, or nurses, or social workers, or lifegaurds, or peace core workers. When I perform and produce something, am I able to see the benefit provided to my customers? That's usually very satisfying for people. Feedback is exactly what it sounds like. You can imagine how strange college would be if you never received writing feedback or grade feedback. When people have to wander in the dark and have no sense of how they are doing it tends to be very dissatisfying. This last one skill variety has the least support, people often find that it doesn't predict satisfaction. Skill variety means that I use multiple skills to complete the task. What people have found to be more imporant is that my skill set is uniquely valuable. So it doesn't matter if I use many different skills throughout the day. What matters is that I complete something that very few others could do. 

Now, so far we just have a list of buzzwords. I find that it's helpful to chunk these in memory with a heuristic, and the heuristic that I like to use is programming. Programming is often intimadating for people because you do have to learn a language. But once you get beyond that initial fear, the task itself is embedded with many of these features. What we are looking at here is an individual writing code for a website. You can see him entering code on the write, and on the left we are witnessing the results of each line of code. At the end of the video, he will have produced an entire website. This task has many of the features I just spoke of. It has autonomy. There are many, many different ways to create a red background, so he has the freedom to write the code as he pleases. It has a lot of identity. He thought a general web layout, started the project, and will get to contribute to all aspects of the work by the time it is finished. There is some significance because there will be users of this website and he will be interacting with those users. Also notice that he is getting immediate feedback. The moment he enters a line of code, it either doesn't work or it produces something on the webpage. 


We also have some evidence on aspects to avoid. Sometimes you hear advice from lay audience on vocational persuits saying "follow your passion." It turns out that this advice isn't all that great. It was explained nicely by stephen dubner of the podcast freakonomics. Often when you say "follow your passion" to a 16 year old, he thinks of surfing, he thinks of music, he thinks of soccer or football. The likelihood of going pro in those domains is next to nothing. What you want to do is consider skills that you can develop that allow you to complete tasks that others don't like doing. What are the skills and areas of expertise that could uniquely contribute to a given domain? Of those, which do I have the capacity to pursue? What do I not mind doing that other people hate doing but find valuable? If you can locate yourself in that situation, well now you have others that look up to you, that depend on you in a positive way, that care about your opinion and your input, and it's often a satisfying position to be in.

A negative predictor that comes up quite often is commute times. People with very long commute times tend to be very dissatisfied in their jobs. Again, this is correlational, so there are many confounds and the direction of causality could be reversed. But nontheless this covariate comes up in many different kinds of studies so it seems to be relevant. 

What don't we know about some of the things I just covered? Well there must be limits to those various features. Obviously you can have too much autonomy. Obviously you can have too much feedback or the wrong form of feedback. We don't have very much information on the extent to which you can ramp up some of these features without losing worker engagement. We also don't know about profiles. Is it the case that you need a job with all of these features? With just one of but a large amount of one of these featuers? Can an absense of one feature be compensated by a sufficient amount of another feature? We have no idea. 

# Individual Performance

Alright topic number two. What do we know about individual performance? About being effective? About getting stuff done? I have the word "ladder" on the slide, what I'm referring to is moving up the ladder. Getting promoted. Penetrating elite institutions. To  talk through some of these variables, I'm going to use a person by situation layout. One of the core predictors of job performance is cognitive ability. We've been studying intelligence forever, and this predictor comes up time and time again. There are people in my field who would say that if you could only measure one variable before making a hiring decision, you should assess cognitive ability. This predictor almost always has the largest coefficient relative to other covariates when predicting job performance.

There is also a bundle of individual differences, personality characteristics that are relevant for job performance. Which one you focus on depends on the performance domain and, frankly, who you talk talk. If you go and talk to Dennis Ones at the University of Minnesota, she'll tell you that apart from cognitive ability conscientiousness is the most important personality characteristics when considering job performnace. If you talk to Russ Johnson in Michigan State's management department, he'll tell you to pay attention to variables like self efficacy and locus of control. If you talk to people who study leadership emergence, and by that I mean bring a bunch of people together and see who emerges as the leader, who gets promoted the fastest, they'll tell you that assertiveness, optimism, who talks the most, and who is the most attractive are all relevant. There's also a bundle of skills that are generalizable across different domains. You are all at a liberal arts college so hopefully you understand the importance of these skills. A tenant of a liberal arts college is that students walk away knowing how to learn, how to write, and how to communicate. Those skills are helpful in any career that you pursue. In terms of situational characteristics, the most commonly studied variales in our field include things like social support, and cultures and climates. Psychological climate was something I studied a lot when I first got into this field and I was working with Amy Green, who used to be a faculty member at USD. Psychological climate refers to the perception I have of my work environment -- to what extent do I perceive that its fair, supportive of my capacities, that people are cohesion and have a shared sense of what it means to do good work in this space. 

Then there are a number of variables that I'm going to bracket with the term human capital investments. Here I'm talking about things like job training, apprenticeship, mentoring, education, workshops, and practice. It's no mystery that it takes lots of practice to get good at something. All of you have probably herd of the 10,000 hours bit...it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. Go listen to David Hambrick's talk where he picks that notion apart. Hambrick is a professor of psychology at Michigan State, he's got a great talk where he sort of dismantles the 10,000 hour idea...but, the notion of deliberate practice is still relevant. Focusing on improving my weaknesses through sustained and purposeful practice is of course relevant to career success. 

All of these components are general. We're focused on broad career success and performance. Some people in organizational psychology study moment to moment or day to day performance. When we zoom in on this closer level of analysis, people would adopt what's called a self-regulation perspective. What is going on in someone's environment, and how does that influence the internal states of a given individual and the actions that she takes, and then how do her actions subsequently change the environment and so on across time. When we adopt this perspective, I would start asking questions like the following. What are her goals like? Are her personal goals consistent with the goals of the organization? Do her goals have an immediate or far deadline? Are they abstract or specific? Do her goals align with the goals of her colleageus? We have a huge literature on the nature of the goals and their functioning in the workplace. We would also focus on the distractions someone might have pulling him off of his core tasks. What behaviors are reinforced? What are managers paying attention to and responding to? If I go and look at performance evaluations...which behaviors are being monitored by the company? If the company is providing yearly evaluations of behavior X and Y but not behavior Z, you can be pretty certain that behavior X and Y is what you should pay attention to. 

This sort of framework is something I used in my dissertation. One part of my dissertation was assessing how employees were pulled away from their core tasks by colleageus asking them for assistance. Imagine receiving a bunch of emails from your colleagues saying "hey can you help me with this? Can you help me with that?" How do people navigate? How do people maintain their performance while accumulating these kinds of prompts in their environment? Here is a trajectory over time for a single individual. We are looking at the number of emails he received asking him for help over 1058 days. The y-axis shows you the number of emails, 0, 50, 100. So 50 would mean that this person has 50 emails asking him for help on side projects. You can see that this trajectory has an accumulating pattern, it trends upward over time. How are people navigating their own individual tasks when disturbances and reinforcers are operating in their environment?

The last aspect I want to mention here is that people aslo spend a lot of time studying how employees monitor their own performance and then make behavioral changes based on their own feedback. I'm going to show you a little video of a baseball pitcher talking about tracking his own performance. He's going to share how he monitors his pitching practice and how adjusted after witnessing his own data. 

Now turning to what we don't know. We don't know how some of the aspects I just mentioned function in the changing nature of work. People in org psych, management, and HR will often throw up these buzzwords when talking about the current workforce (protean and boundaryless). Essentially, what they are talking about is that people no longer spend their entire career at one company. People have boundaryless careers, they switch jobs, they switch majors. They don't expect to work for the same employer for their whole lifetime. Companies are also becoming more horizontal. Rather than having 700 core employees with a strict hierarchy, organizations have 10 people, they all work collaboratively, and they hire on contract work for various projects. How does our understanding of performance change given the new nature of work that seems to be emerging?


# Team Performance

The first concept that I'll present is going to sound a little silly, but I think it's very important. And that is the concept of process loss. Don't ever ask a team to do something that an individual could do on her own. Just because you bring people together does not mean that they will be able to produce something that is of higher quality than what a single individual could have produced on her own. They have to communicate, they have to coordinate, they have to work well together...there is no gaurantee that that will happen. This used to be a baseline in our field, it used to be a null hypothesis. If I ran a study on teams, and I wanted to show that whatever I was studying had an effect on team performance, I had to show that the product that was produced by the team was of higher quality than what a single individual could have produced on his or her own. It's no longer very popular, it sort of died out. You can imagine why, it's tough to beat. 

Division of labor is another historical variable in our field. Allow people to specialize to reduce time wasted from task switching. The case study for this comes from Ford Motor Company. I'm sitting in Lansing MI right now, an hour away is Detroit, which is home to the headquarters of Ford. In 1913 they tracked the number of hours it took to produce a car. How many hours does it take to produce on of their vehicles. This is in 1913. They found that it took 12.5 hours to produce a vehicle. In 1913, this was prior to using an assembly line. There was no division of labor. In that same year, 1913, they then implemented the assembly line, they implemented division of labor. When they did so, they were able to produce a car in 1 and a half hours. This, in my opinion, is frickin amazing. This is a success story that does not get told. The year prior to 1913 they could produce 60,000 cars a year. The year after 1913, they could produce 170,000 cars a year. They did not hire anyone or fire anyone. There were no personnel changes. All they did was change the structure of the work. 

Wisdom of the crowds is pretty popular right now, the notion of collective intelligence. Imagine I bring together a collective of people and I have them, for example, predict the weight of a cow. Person one guesses that the cow weighs 1900 lbs, person two guessses that the cow weighs 2000 ibs. Person three and four make their guess. If I take the average of those, I often find that the calculated number of very close to the true weight of the cow. That is the wisdom of the crowds effect. Now, what this depends on is that each individual is making an independent prediction. There prediction errors must be uncorrelated, they must be independent. This is exactly the same idea as the assumption of independent errors in statistical modeling. For all of you stats guru's out there, when I apply a statistical model I assume that my errors are uncorrelated, they are independent. That's exactly what's going on here. People are wrong, they have prediction errors when they guess the weight of the cow, and those errors need to be independent for this wisdom of the crowds effect to work. If I allow the people to talk to each other, then one persuasive individual is going to convince everyone to guess a certain weight and all of their prediction errors become correlated. This effect requires independent prediction errors. 

Diversity is giant right now. Lots going on here. I'm not really an expert in this area so I'm not going to linger on it. I just wanted to say that if you enjoy diversity definitely go pick up scott page's books, he has a couple of them. Go read scott page's work and that'll bring you up to speed on diversity. 

If you go to a talk on teams you will definitely hear people throw around the buzzword "lever" or "levers." What levers do we know to increase team performance? What levers can we use to increase team performance? When people say that, what they are referring to is a collection of variables like those on the slide. Shared vision means a collective sense of buy in. Do my members know what they are trying to accomplish, why they are doing so, and do they buy into that? Transcactive memory is very hot right now. Lot's of research in this area. What this means is a shared understanding of who knows what. I know that John is good at X, and Susan is good at Y. So when I have a problem I know exactly who to go talk to. Leadership is of course relevant. Leadership is another area that I'm not an expert in so I'm not going to say much about it. 

I wanted to share a study by Judi Komaki. I think she's a champ, I think everyone should know who she is. Unfortunately, many people don't and there's sort of a historical reason for that, it's kind of a sad story. Nonetheless, I wanted to offer one of her studies that demonstrates some of the effects I just talked about. She went into a company and observed them for 65 days. What she was monitoring was the number of safety behaviors among various teams. Technically on the y-axis she tracked the percentage of safety behaviors, but you can just think of that as the number of safety behaviors across various teams. The first thing she did was just observe. Just show up and watch, and count the number of safety behaviors. She gathered a baseline. If I was to put a horizontal line through those data points, it would be at about 50 or 60%. 60% safety behaviors at baseline. She then implemented an intervention, using some of the levers I just spoke of. She spoke to the supervisors at the company. She had them start modeling safety behaviors. She had them start praising people for behaving safely. She also had meetings with the individual employees. She was able to get buy-in. She was able to change their mindset and to get them to start thinking, yes we want this to be a safe environment to work in. We want to build a culture here where we care about and value safety. We want people to know that safe behaviors are a core aspect to what it means to work here. Once she did that, safety behaviors rose up to about 95 to 100%. She then removed the intervention and the behaviors dropped back down to baseline levels, which is sort of a sad story but that's what you get with some of the ABA designs. Definitely look up Judi Komaki if you're interested in some of these things.

Changing now to what we don't know. What I'm going to mention actually isnt' something we don't know, it's more something that just bugs me. And that is, there is a tendency to provide what I would call congruent explanations in this literature. That's the nice way to say it. The mean way to say it, is that sometimes people provide explanations that are abstract, they hedge their bets, and therefore they are unhelpful. I'm going to give you an example of what I mean. There is a book that just came out, it's all about team performance. This is a 2020 book, it juts came out. It's by Scott Tannenbaum and Edwuardo Salas. These are two giants in my field. To disagree with them is to commit academic suicide ha! Nonetheless, I'm going to say what I have to say. In this book, they write about "levers." Aspects you should consider to improve team performance. Here is what you should do to make sure your team is going to perform well. I'm going to give you one example from their book. To ensure your team performs well, make sure the context is favorable to performing well. If you want your team to perform well, make sure the context is favorable to performing well. Do you see it? Do you see it? Do you see it? That's like saying, If you want your basketball team to win, make sure they score more points than the other team. Yeah, of course. That's what it means to win. We can do better than this. We can be less abstract than this. This is so general that it isn't very helpful. It's defined in the direction of what it means to perform well. I wanted to point this out so all of you can be sure that you're critical about some of this material. I should add that I've had dinner with both scott and ed and I like both of them alot. I just thought I'd mention this. 

# Methods

We've been talking about performance, productivity, being effective, getting stuff done. I care about these topics not only among employees, but also among scientists. I consider myself a scientist, a researcher. What tools, techniques, methods are we using to be productive scientists? How are we asking questions? How are we gathering data? How are we analyzing that data? How are we making inferences about the patterns that we witness? I spend about half of my time writing methods articles, articles about improving our tools and techniques as scientists. I wanted to be sure I included this because when I was an undergrad, when I was 18,19,20, I actually wasn't aware that you could write these kinds of articles. I wasn't aware that you could do this in psychology. So I thought I'd share. 

One of the things I write a lot about is data or what you might call project management. How should you think about and organize your files, scripts, and documents to be effective and efficient in research...especially knowing that in research you often come back to projects not having looked at them in some time. Imagine that you were conducting a project for a while but then had other things to do and then you were only able to return to the project two years later. That was fairly common in my experience in graduate school. I had projects that I started my first year, then other things came up and I put my attention elsewhere. Then I was only able to come back to those projects 2 or 3 or 4 years down the road. Imagine you are coming back to this project 2 years after not having looked at it. You want to start moving again, you want to get things rolling again. You open up the folder, and this is what you see. Couple of questions to consider. What was I doing the last time I was working on this project? What were the next steps? What were some issues that came up? Which file am I supposed to open so as to remind myself what I was doing? We live in the era of reproducible research, I'm suppossed to be able to reproduce my stuff, can I reproduce this? I have a couple of different data files. What is stored in those various files? How do I know that I have the right data? I have a word document in the middle...version 6. I imagine that means there's a version 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Where are those other versions? What if I want to see them? These questions are unfair because I created this imagine and you didn't. But that is exactly what it feels like to come back to a project after 3 years of not having looked at it. How can you set this up so as to be effective and efficient with yourself knowing that research has these breaks? I'm writing a paper about this exact topic right now with Goran and Mike, both of them are at DePaul University. Hopefully that'll come out in about a year and a half. 

One more topic: computational modeling. Computational modeling just means implemented your ideas in code, in syntax. All of you have expressed ideas in text. You've explained something using words in a document. You can do the same thing in code. You can implement your model in code. Why would you want to do that? We've been talking about performance and being effective. Why would you want to implement your thoughts in code? To demonstrate why...I have a little exercise. After the exercise, hopefully it'll be more clear why you would want to. I'm going to show you two sentences. The sentences say the same thing, they just use different words. Here is the first sentence, go ahead and read that. Now I'm going to show you the same sentence, but using different words. Go ahead and read it. If it tickled your mind to move from sentence 1 to sentence 2, then you would enjoy computational modeling. When you express ideas in text, there is a tendency to be abstract, and wordy, and fluffy, and surround your idea with a lot of scholarly gunk that's hard to read. When you put that idea in code, it gets right to the meat of the explanation. Right to the meat of the idea. The other thing it does is that it shows you contradictions. When you use fluffy, wordy, gunky acadademicy words, it's easy to offer an explanation that doesn't make sense. Logically, it doesn't work. But you can't tell because the fluffy words obstruct the illogical statements. Computational modeling is the exercise of removing the gunk and getting down to just the logic of your explanation.
